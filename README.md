# forkify-app

The project was developed using a range of technologies including HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. 

To ensure compatibility with various browsers, I utilized Babel as a JavaScript compiler and Parcel as a bundler.

One of the most significant aspects of the project was the DOM update algorithm.
This enabled me to update only the necessary DOM elements, rather than reloading the entire DOM, which greatly improved the application's performance and user experience. 
This algorithm was inspired by the Virtual DOM idea in React.

Throughout the project, I honed my skills in a variety of other areas,including Object Oriented Programming (OOP), the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, and the Publisher-Subscriber pattern for event handling. I also implemented other important features, such as pagination, a search function, and the ability for users to add their own recipes and bookmark their favorite ones while the bookmarked ones are being preserved in the browser's local Storage to keep them saved even with a page reload.

It's important to note that while developing "Forkify", I chose not to focus on making the application responsive on all screen sizes. This decision was made deliberately to allow me to prioritize and allocate my time more efficiently towards the JavaScript development aspects of the application.

Overall, the Forkify project was an excellent opportunity for me to showcase my technical skills and demonstrate my ability to create dynamic and responsive web applications. I am excited to continue building on these skills and taking on new challenges in the future.
